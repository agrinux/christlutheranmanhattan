# Divine Service

**In the Divine Service, God comes to us with His gifts of forgiveness, life, and salvation**. We receive these gifts, then we give Him thanksgiving and praise. Please join us to receive these gifts and give God praise and thanksgiving on Sundays at 10:30 AM.

## Overview

**The Divine Service should be Christ–centered and not man–centered.** It should focus on the forgiveness of sins and not on what the people want. It should be a “heaven on earth” and not like the local pop concert. It should be holy and not casual. It should be centered on building faith in Christ and not on building up the emotions. It should be a common form and language for everyone (old and young, rich and poor, parents, and children) and not cater to one particular generation. 

**Worship and faith go together.** As we worship, so we believe; and as we believe, so we worship. If you want to understand what we believe, then join us in worship. 

**The liturgy serves to provide the structure through which forgiveness, life, and salvation are delivered to us.** It provides the form and shape of the service. Just because a self–chosen form of worship may appeal to a person’s feelings; it should not be used. When a homemade order of service seeks to be “relevant”, it runs the risk of turning attention away from God and onto us.

**The hymnal is one of the most important books in teaching the Christian faith.** It should always remain faithful to the Word of God. Hymns are simply doctrine put into poetic form. They are not the work of one person, one culture, or one generation. They not only reflect the great Lutheran tradition, but they also come from ancient Hebrew, Greek, Latin, European, African, North American, and African American sources.

In the Divine Service, God gives us the Gospel from the baptismal font, the pulpit, and the altar. We receive these gifts of salvation, then we give Him thanksgiving in word and in song.

## The Liturgy

### Preparation

#### Confession and Absolution
The service begins with confession of sins and the pronouncement of absolution. Scripture teaches:

> If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
> <cite>1 John 1:9</cite>

#### Introit
A Psalm that introduces the theme of the day. The Apology of the Augsburg Confession states:

> We keep traditional liturgical forms, such as the order of readings, prayers, vestments, and other similar things.
> <cite>Apology XXIV.1</cite>

### Service of the Word

#### Kyrie
The congregation cries "Lord, have mercy" (Greek: Kyrie eleison), echoing the blind man's plea:

> Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!
> <cite>Luke 18:38</cite>

#### Gloria in Excelsis
The song of the angels at Christ's birth:

> Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom He is pleased!
> <cite>Luke 2:14</cite>

#### The Readings
- Old Testament
- Epistle
- Holy Gospel

As our Lord promises:

> The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.
> <cite>John 6:63</cite>

#### Creed
We confess either the Nicene or Apostles' Creed, as the Formula of Concord states:

> We believe, teach, and confess that these symbols are the true and pure exposition of the Word of God.
> <cite>Formula of Concord, Epitome</cite>

#### Sermon
The proclamation of Law and Gospel, as St. Paul writes:

> Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching.
> <cite>2 Timothy 4:2</cite>

### Service of the Sacrament

#### Preface and Sanctus
The congregation joins the song of the seraphim:

> Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory!
> <cite>Isaiah 6:3</cite>

#### The Lord's Prayer
As Christ taught us to pray.

#### Words of Institution
Christ's own words establish His real presence:

> This is My body... This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
> <cite>Matthew 26:26, 28</cite>

#### Distribution
Luther explains in the Large Catechism:

> We must never regard the sacrament as a harmful thing from which we should flee, but as a pure, wholesome, soothing medicine which aids and quickens us in both soul and body.
> <cite>Large Catechism V.68</cite>

#### Post-Communion Collect
Giving thanks for the gifts received.

#### Benediction
The service concludes with the Aaronic blessing:

> The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace.
> <cite>Numbers 6:24-26</cite>

## What to Expect

When you visit for the Divine Service, you'll experience:

- Jesus as the center in both our preaching and teaching
- The forgiveness of sins is at the heart of the Divine Service
- Traditional Lutheran Liturgy from the Lutheran Service Book
- Historic vestments
- Congregational singing of Lutheran hymns
- The Lord's Supper is served every Sunday

For first time visitors to the Divine Service, here are some important things to know:

- Take a bulletin (available in the narthex / entryway)
- Feel free to sit anywhere, please fill out the red attendence book available in each row after being seated
- Grab a Lutheran Service Book (under the chairs) that we will follow during the Divine Service
- The service typically lasts a little over an hour
- We practice closed communion ***see note below***
- Our Pastor will greet everyone as they leave

**Regarding Holy Communion**: Closed communion is an ancient practice dating back to the Apostles' themselves. Those who do not properly confess what Scripture teaches regarding Christ and His Supper must not be given the Sacrament (1 Cor 10:17 | 1 Cor 11:27 | 1 Cor 11:29). Those who are members of the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod are invited to the Lord's Supper. We invite others to learn about the Gospel and Sacrament in a new member class before taking communion.
