          Located on the east side of the Manhattan, Kansas, Christ Lutheran Church delivers the Gospel in Word and Sacrament 
so that sinners receive the forgiveness of sins â€‹and so that others may come to faith in Christ.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Christ Lutheran Church is distinctly Lutheran in theology, historic in worship, faithful in preaching God's Word, and devoted to reflecting the light of Christ. Our worship is reverent and follows the historic liturgy of the Church, connecting us to the faith once delivered to the saints.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Whether you're new to Confessional Lutheranism, a K-State student, seeking a new church home, or visiting Manhattan - we invite you to join us for worship and in receiving Christ's gifts through Word and Sacrament in the Divine Service at Christ Lutheran Church.
